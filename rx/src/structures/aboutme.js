        Paco is a strong believer of expanding the scope of pharmacy practice in British Columbia
        to synchronize the advance with the rest of the Canadian provinces. Medication reviews, immunizations and
        adaptations were good starts but in the summer of 2023, the long awaited pharmacist prescribing finally comes
        into action.

        Paco seeks to incorporate his knowledge in computer science into pharmaceutical practice to 
        improve patient outcomes, share knowledge and provide guidance to his fellow pharmacists. 
        Cheers!
