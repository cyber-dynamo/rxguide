        Yet, his childhood dream to become a software developer keeps him
        advancing even more. Off duty, Paco enjoys to research on interesting computer
        science knowledge such as basic computer algorithms, databases,front end frameworks such 
        as react, redux state managing toolkits. It is not unusual to see him challenging 
        leetcode questions and building softwares.

        Paco is a strong believer of expanding the scope of pharmacy practice in British Columbia
        to synchronize the advance with the rest of the Canadian provinces. Medication reviews, immunizations and
        adaptations were good starts but in the summer of 2023, pharmacist prescribing finally comes
        into action.

        Paco seeks to incorporate his knowledge in computer science into pharmaceutical practice to 
        improve patient outcomes, share knowledge and provide guidance to his fellow pharmacists. 
        And hence, this page is born!
